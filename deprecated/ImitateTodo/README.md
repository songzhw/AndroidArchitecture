# Introduction

Google published some architectures for us recently. These are precious resource, and I try to learn and rebuild a similar projects.  This project is a imitating project of Google-todo-MVP. However, it is not the same project. Because I do not like everything in the Google todo-MVP project.

# The advantage of Google todo-MVP
1. By using "prod" and "mock" productFlavors, and building "prod" and "mock" directory under the "src" directory, the project easily separate the mock codes and the release codes.
2. The test is good enough. There are tests for presenter, for DB, for View. And we surely can learn a lot from it.
